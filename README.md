What program did I make and what is it about:

At the start i was finding it hard to know what program to make, but i had made a little quiz where you can test your knowledge to see what you know and don't know.
This quiz is based around countries and continents. I was unsure of an topic to go off throughout my quiz as i wanted it to be kept around as one/same topic 
so then it wasn't confusing so that's why i did it around countries and continents.


How I made it:

Before i started making it i did some research for more of an understanding of the process on how to make the quiz. 
I originally made it through a free google chrome app that is called replit. It's a free online place where you can code (using python) etc etc. 
Once i had coded it and fixed up any issues that i had with my code. I ran it through IDLE Python 3.10 just to make sure everything is working correctly.

What I found easy about it:
