My Research Repository.

What program did I make and what is it about:

At the start i was finding it hard to know what program to make, but i had made a little quiz where you can test your knowledge to see what you know and don't know.
This quiz is based around countries and continents. I was unsure of an topic to go off throughout my quiz as i wanted it to be kept around as one/same topic 
so then it wasn't confusing so that's why i did it around countries and continents.

---------------------------------
How I made it:

Before i started making it i did some research for more of an understanding of the process on how to make the quiz. 
I originally made it through a free google chrome app that is called replit. It's a free online place where you can code (using python) etc etc. 
Once i had coded it and fixed up any issues that i had with my code. I ran it through IDLE Python 3.10 just to make sure everything is working correctly.

---------------------------------
What I found easy about it:

What i found easy about this quiz was when i had found/decided on a topic i already few questions in my head that i included into my quiz.
Once i couldn't think of any more questions i researched  questions that i could include into my quiz.
To make all the code work was easy as i didn't have much errors through the process of creating the quiz and but for when i did have errors 
they were simple fixes. ex. indents,wrong syntax, something that was defined correctly etc.

---------------------------------
What I found hard about it: 

I didn't really find much hard. I guess what i found hard was to pick a topic because there a varieties of topics that you can pick from and i couldn't choose one.
I had a simple error that took me ages to be able to change and fix. "TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3" was the error i couldn't solve. 
So then i did some research and had resolved it.

---------------------------------
Why did i make what i did:

I was finding it hard to decide on what program i should make ex. calculator, paper scissors rock, chatbot etc. I wasn't sure what to make and i had decided to
just make a quiz 

---------------------------------
What did my resources help me with:

- "TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3" this was an error i had and i needed to use the internet to understand the error abit more to fix it.
it was an error that i just couldn't see till i had fixed it.

- This one was to just get an more of understanding on how to use ask for user input to recap on how it works so then i used it correctly

 - This website was for an idea on how the python code process would work and see the different methods on how to create my quiz.

   (Improvement quiz version 2)
 - This is another quiz that i found that had a score count if the user gets the question correct. Made it work with my quiz and has no issues with it

  (Research work)
 - These are resource of different methods of how to make a random number generator. I have 3 different codes in my random gen page 
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-numbers-in-python/
  This video is another method of randon number generator. I wanted to get mutiple methods so theirs choices

---------------------------------
What could I add to improve my program:

What i could add to my quiz/ improve is to add a score count. So when you get an answer correct after you answer each question it will count the score up by 1
each time you get a question correct and then to print out how many you got correct afterwards so then your score is kept tracked easily.

---------------------------------
Quiz version 2:

As apart of what i could improve with my program the suggestion that i had made was to make a score that counts the questions that the user gets correct. 
I have made a quiz version 2.0 that a score is used to count the amount of questions that the user answers and gets correct. This is used as an improvement
on my quiz so then your score is kept tracked as you answer throughout the quiz.

Random number generator is part of my research work

Reflective prompts questions:

- What is python?
Python is a computer programming language. Python is used to be able to create variety of different types of programs and it's also used to automate tasks, build websites etc.

- Have you developed a habit of exploring?
I have, i use google to help me learn and understand things better. I use it to research python coding on how to create things as I don't remember everything and what
some of the words means. researching things helps me understands in ways of i don't understand like errors that happen when i'm creating in python and explore
different websites to understand the issue and to try resolve it.

- Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Readme file. The most tedious part of the work i would say is writing. for example in my read me file i have written quite abit and i get bored of it but at the same
time i don't mind writing 

- What is a varaiable 
A variable is a datatype where you can set/assign vaule to a variable. It stores vaules of different types

- What are you looking forward to learning about programming
mainly extended my knowledge/ability about python. Python has been the main language i have used since highschool. It was never taught in an easy way and i want to 
learn it in a different way for me to understand things better.

- What programming languages are you interested in learning? why?
Python because its the only programming lanugage i've used but it's a language that i'm relearning because i haven't done it for years but i know some what of the basics off by heart so i got some type of understanding of it all
