What program did I make and what is it about:

At the start i was finding it hard to know what program to make, but i had made a little quiz where you can test your knowledge to see what you know and don't know.
This quiz is based around countries and continents. I was unsure of an topic to go off throughout my quiz as i wanted it to be kept around as one/same topic 
so then it wasn't confusing so that's why i did it around countries and continents.

How I made it:

Before i started making it i did some research for more of an understanding of the process on how to make the quiz. 
I originally made it through a free google chrome app that is called replit. It's a free online place where you can code (using python) etc etc. 
Once i had coded it and fixed up any issues that i had with my code. I ran it through IDLE Python 3.10 just to make sure everything is working correctly.

What I found easy about it:

What i found easy about this quiz was when i had found/decided on a topic i already few questions in my head that i included into my quiz.
Once i couldn't think of any more questions i researched  questions that i could include into my quiz.
To make all the code work was easy as i didn't have much errors through the process of creating the quiz and but for when i did have errors 
they were simple fixes. ex. indents,wrong syntax, something that was defined correctly etc.

What I found hard about it: 

I didn't really find much hard. I guess what i found hard was to pick a topic because there a varieties of topics that you can pick from and i couldn't choose one.
I had a simple error that took me ages to be able to change and fix. "TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3" was the error i couldn't solve. 
So then i did some research and had resolved it.

Why did i make what i did:

I was finding it hard to decide on what program i should make ex. calculator, paper scissors rock, chatbot etc. I wasn't sure what to make and i had decided to
just make a quiz 

What did my resources help me with:

- "TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3" this was an error i had and i needed to use the internet to understand the error abit more to fix it.
it was an error that i just couldn't see till i had fixed it.

- This one was to just get an more of understanding on how to use ask for user input to recap on how it works so then i used it correctly

 - This website was for an idea on how the python code process would work and see the different methods on how to create my quiz.

What could I add to improve my program:

What i could add to my quiz/ improve is to add a score count. So when you get an answer correct after you answer each question it will count the score up by 1
each time you get a question correct and then to print out how many you got correct afterwards so then your score is kept tracked easily.
